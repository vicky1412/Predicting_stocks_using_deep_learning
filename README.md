# Predicting_stocks_using_deep_learning

I developed a model to predict the stocks using deep learning.

Preparing the data - getting the data from yayoo finance.

model - Time Series Sequantial 
layers - keras(dense,LSTM(long short term memory))

accuracy = 82%

I will imporve this as much as possible 

thank you.
