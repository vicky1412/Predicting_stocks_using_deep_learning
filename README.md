# Predicting_stocks_using_deep_learning


Preparing the data - getting the data from yayoo finance and alpha vantage.

model - Time Series Sequantial ,randomforestregression and randomforestclassification.

layers - keras(dense,LSTM(long short term memory))

accuracy = 70% - 78%

can easily implement the model in realtime
under models repository you can find codes the models.
under gdrive folder can find link the trained models.


thank you.
